The bamboo plantations will be promoted predominantly in farmers’ fields, homesteads, community lands, arable wastelands, and along irrigation canals, water bodies etc.\nii) To improve post-harvest management through establishment of innovative primary processing units near the source of production, primary treatment and seasoning plants, preservation technologies and market infrastructure.\niii) To promote product development keeping in view market demand, by assisting R&D, entrepreneurship & business models at micro, small and medium levels and feed bigger industry.\niv) To rejuvenate the under developed bamboo industry in India.\nv) To promote skill development, capacity building, awareness generation for development of bamboo sector from production to market demand.\nvi) To realign efforts so as to reduce dependency on import of bamboo and bamboo products by way of improved productivity and suitability of domestic raw material for industry, so as to enhance income of the primary producers.",

However, the impact of the scheme was found not to be at the desired level as many beneficiaries are found unable to construct their houses up to the roof level in the desirable manner due to the poor economic condition. So the Government has decided to discontinue the scheme and in its place decided to construct houses. With the objective of providing decent houses to the poor families in the State particularly in the Rural areas, the Department proposes to implement a New Housing Scheme called the “Chief Minister’s Housing Assistance Programmes” to replace the Rural Housing Scheme. Under this scheme 3(three) bundles of roofing materials will be provided for the EWS families and to provide dwelling houses to the LIG families with the objective of providing decent houses to the poor families. It is proposed to implement the new Chief Minister’s Housing Assistance Programme with the proposed outlay of Rs.20.00 crore to be earmarked under this scheme during the year 2016-17.",
